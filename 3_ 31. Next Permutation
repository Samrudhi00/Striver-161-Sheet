========= we have C++ STL LIBRARY function   ======
///
td::next_permutation
It is used to rearrange the elements in the range [first, last) into the next lexicographically greater permutation.
A permutation is each one of the N! possible arrangements the elements can take (where N is the number of elements in the range). 
Different permutations can be ordered according to how they compare lexicographically to each other.
The complexity of the code is O(n*n!) which also includes printing all the permutations.
